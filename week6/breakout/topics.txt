Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
	- Some APIs may block requests coming from origins they don't trust
		- hitting http://pokeapi.co from http://mysweetsite.com
	- Solutions
		- JSONP (JSON with Padding)
			- appends a script tag with a src attribute
			- Some APIs support JSONP, but not all of them will
			- In Angular, the $http service has a jsonp method (GET)
			$http.jsonp(URL).then(CB);

		- Server-side requests
			- make http requests from our server
			- most reliable way to ping an API
			- Typical flow : make a request on the front-end to your OWN server.  It then makes a request to the API
