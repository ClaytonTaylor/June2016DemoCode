OOP Inheritance

	- Creating a hierarchy of classes

2 kinds of relationships
	is a
	has a

menus HAVE SOME plates
plates HAVE SOME foodItems
restaurant HAS A menu

dog IS A mammal
whale IS A mammal

IS A relationships are a good use case for inheritance.  This is because there are probably common properties or methods they might share

Even if you have an IS A relationship, only use inheritance to save yourself code
