HTML Intro
=========

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this lecture is to review the basics of HTML and CSS. Ideally, students learned these basic concepts during the prework. The instructor should try to engage students as much as possible during this lecture to make sure that the class is on the same page. 

Students should understand basic HTML concepts, such as tags, elements, content, attributes, required html tags, and nesting.

Students should understand basic CSS concepts, such as CSS properties, values, selectors, child selectors, selecting by class or ID, and the general mechanics of how styles can override other styles.
