Document Flow
    - How the browser formats or lays HTML elements out on a page
    - Top  - Down
    - Left - Right
    
Display - affects how an element carries dimensions and whether or not it can share line space

    Block - 
        - Has a line break before and after itself
            - It will NOT share space on a line
        - By default, they will take up 100% width
        - div, p, h1-6, section
        - Have dimensions
    
    Inline -
        - Share space on a line
        - span, strong, em
        - Do NOT have dimensions
            - They get their dimensions from the CONTENT inside of them
    
    Inline-Block - 
        - Most flexible display type - best of both worlds
        - img(not technically inline-block but behaves EXACTLY like it would if it was)
        - Share space on a line
        - Have dimensions
    
    None - 
        - The element is no longer rendered
        - No longer takes up space or affects other elements' layout
            - Removed from the DOCUMENT FLOW
            
Position - Affects the physical location or visual representation of an element
         - Putting elements in places where they wouldn't normally go if the browser had any say in it
         - Often paired with COORDINATE properties - top, left, bottom, right
    
    Static - 
        - Every element is statically positioned by default
        - Where the browser wants to lay the element out
        - Elements are considered "unpositioned"
    
    Fixed - 
        - Positioned with respect to the WINDOW (viewable area in the browser)
        - Stay on the screen when the page is scrolled
        - floating nav bar that's always available
        - Removing the element from the DOCUMENT FLOW

    Relative -
        - Positioned with respect to itself
        - DOES NOT remove the element from the DOCUMENT FLOW
        - Doesn't change WHERE the element takes us space
            - Only changes the visual representation
    
    Absolute - 
        - Positioned with respect to its closest positioned ancestor or the BODY
        - REMOVE the element from DOCUMENT FLOW
            - Does NOT take up space

Floats
    Originally they were designed to help text / images wrap around one another, like a newspaper article
    
    A Floated element is MOSTLY removed from the document flow
        It only affects the positioning of content that is wrapping around it
    
    Float
        - left
        - right
        - none
    
    Clear
        - Property designed to control how elements can share space with a float
        - Chooses a side and will NOT share space with a floated element on that side
        - left
        - right
        - both
        - none
    
    Overflow
        - Typically deals with content inside of elements
        - Used to show or hide overflowing content
            - letting it expand outside of the container
            - constraining it with scroll bars
            - hiding the content that expands outside alltogether
