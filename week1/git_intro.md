Git Intro
========

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this lecture is to give students a basic, practical understanding of git and github.

Students should learn what a git repository is, why they would want to use git, and the difference between git and github. 

Students should learn how to initialize a repository, commit their work, add a remote, and push to the remote. In this lecture, students will not learn more powerful git features like branching, merging, reverting, or diffing. For day 1, we just want students to get into the habit of backing up their work on github every hour or so. 

Lecture Notes
------------

Students should follow along with the instructor, initializing, committing, and pushing the HTML/CSS project they made in the previous lecture while following along with the instructor.
