MongoDB!


MongoDb is a no SQL database

 - Don't use SQL to query it
 - Structured query language
 - In Mongo, you'll pass query objects

SQL vs NoSQL

 SQL
   - Relational Database
   - Stored in a flat tabular system (tables)
   - Much like a spreadsheet
   - Very structured
     - Must define schema (structure of data)
   - Typically scales vertically
     - Verticaly scaling is increasing power on a single machine
   - Query language

 NoSQL

   - Flat, schemaless database
     - weak / no relationships
   - Typically scales horizontally
     - More machines (helps distribute load)
     - NoSQL db were created to overcome these limitations of vertical scaling
   - Data can be much more dynamic
     - Change structure on the fly
     - Reduce the chance of data migration
     - Resembles JSON data called BSON
   - Faster than SQL
     - No / weak relationships

MongoDB - HuMONGOus DB
    Written in C++, very fast DOCUMENT oriented storage
    Built in support for scaling (sharding, clustering)
    Flat-file database - data is stored in flat, BSON files

MongoDB Terminology / Structure
DATABASE - where all the smaller mongodb constructs are stored.  Database is kind of like a namespace

COLLECTIONS - a DATABASE may have multiple COLLECTIONS.  COLLECTIONS are analogous in many ways to arrays
            - SQL Table

DOCUMENTS - COLLECTIONS may have multiple DOCUMENTS.  DOCUMENTS are analogous in many ways to objects
          - SQL Row

DB  : bijansFunHouseDB
COL : users, employees     
DOC : { name : 'bill' }

users => [{name : 'bill'}, {}, {}, {}]


Installation on Mac
   - Homebrew http://brew.sh
   - brew install mongodb

Installation on Windows
    - GUI installer
    - https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
    - Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit and later, with SSL support
    - Export the bin/ folder inside of where MongoDB is installed to your path


Using MongoDB
    FIRST TIME - MAKE SURE YOU EXIT YOUR TERMINAL OR COMMAND LINE AND RESTART IT

    2 Major commands
     
        - mongod (may need sudo)
            - starts a server and listens for DB connections on port 27017
            - YOU MUST BE RUNNING THIS COMMAND TO USE MONGODB
        
        - mongo
            - gets you into the mongo SHELL
            - Command line interface for interacting with mongodb

MongoShell commands
    show dbs      : lists databases stored in the mongoDB data directory you connected to using the mongod command (ls for mongodb)

    use <dbname>  : connects to a database / preps mongodb to create a database (mongodb won't actually formally create a database until there is data being stored in it).  This command also sets context for many other commands

    show collections : lists the collections in the database

    db.<collectionname>.insert(DOCUMENT) : This will insert a DOCUMENT into the COLLECTION.  Will create the collection if it doesn't exist

    db.<collectionname>.find(QUERY)      : This will find DOCUMENTS in the COLLECTION that match QUERY parameters

    db.<collectionname>.update(QUERY, UPDATE) : Updates documents that match the query

    db.<collectionname>.remove(QUERY)  : Deletes documents from a collection


    Super destructive

    db.<collectionname>.drop()   : Destroys the collection and all documents inside

    db.dropDatabase()            : Destroy the entire database you are 'using'
