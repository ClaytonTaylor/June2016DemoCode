# Warm up!

Good morning class!

We are covering Angular factories and filters!

For your warmup exercise:

- Create a blank angular page
    * pull in angular from a `cdn`
    * declare your module as ` ng-app="CakeApp" `
    * create two controllers (using **controller as** syntax):
        - `MenuController`
        - `MenuOrderController`
