What is Angular?

	Framework
	SPA

	A strongly opionionated, front-end, MVC framework

	- Strongly Opionionated
		- All-in-one solution
			- Doesn't always play well with others
			- Wants you to do things the 'Angular way'
		- Don't be dogmatic!  Sometimes the best solution is outside of angular

	-Front-end
		- Angular is something that only lives in the BROWSER
		- It DOES have ways of interacting with the back-end, but only lives in the front-end

	- MVC
		- MVC is an architectural pattern for structuring an application

		M - Model
			- Raw data that drives your application
			- Something that describes the structure of your data

		V - View
			- What the user sees
			- Visual representation of the MODEL

		C - Controller
			- Glue between the MODEL and VIEW
			- Most of your application logic will live here


	- Framework
		- Javascript that someone else wrote so that we can make apps with it
		- Also has components, elements, etc. that are pre-defined to make our lives easier
